It is a safety measure usually taken by an operating system's kernel upon detecting an internal *fatal error* in which eitheir it is unable to safely recover or continuing to run the system would have a high risk of major data loss.

Equivalent on Microsoft Windows would be *the blue screen of death*.

Possible reasons to Kernel Panic:
1. Inappropriate attempt by OS to write to RAM
2. Software bugs or malware
3. Faulty hardware
4. Incompatible drivers

Ways to avoid kernel panic:
1. Normally Kernel Panic doesn't happen so often and actually is pretty rare.
2. To avoid, see your computer specifications of hardware to be installed and not just install new memory with any frequency clock for example
3. For system kernel panic you must keep your system up-to-date
